## Hearbeat reader with Android companion app

This is a project I did for my Embedded Systems class. It consists of two parts:
- a Raspberry Pi Pico that uses a heartbeat sensor to read the user's heartbeat and sends it over Bluetooth LE
- a React Native app that receives it from the Pico and displays it to the user. The app is built using Expo.
